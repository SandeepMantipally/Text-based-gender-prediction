## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text input and predict gender based on learned linguistic patterns.

The model is trained using:
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer / TF-IDF
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier

The application allows users to enter text and instantly get a gender prediction.
